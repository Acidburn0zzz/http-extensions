1.  Introduction

   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] allows clients to coalesce different origins
   [RFC6454] onto the same connection when certain conditions are met.
   However, in certain cases, a connection is is not usable for a
   coalesced origin, so the 421 (Misdirected Request) status code
   ([RFC7540], Section 9.1.2) was defined.

   Using a status code in this manner allows clients to recover from
   misdirected requests, but at the penalty of adding latency.  To
   address that, this specification defines a new HTTP/2 frame type,
   "ORIGIN", to allow servers to indicate what origins a connection is
   usable for.

   Additionally, experience has shown that HTTP/2's requirement to
   establish server authority using both DNS and the server's
   certificate is onerous.  This specification relaxes the requirement
   to check DNS when the ORIGIN frame is in use.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft                ORIGIN Frames                February 2017


2.  The ORIGIN HTTP/2 Frame

   The ORIGIN HTTP/2 frame ([RFC7540], Section 4) allows a server to
   indicate what origin(s) [RFC6454] the server would like the client to
   consider as members of the Origin Set (Section 2.1) for the
   connection it occurs within.

   The ORIGIN frame type is 0xb (decimal 11).


   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |         Origin-Len (16)       | Origin? (*)                 ...
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

   The ORIGIN frame's payload contains the following fields, sets of
   which may be repeated within the frame to indicate multiple origins:

   Origin-Len:  An unsigned, 16-bit integer indicating the length, in
      octets, of the Origin field.

   Origin:  An optional sequence of characters containing the ASCII
      serialization of an origin ([RFC6454], Section 6.2) that the
      sender believes this connection is or could be authoritative for.

   The ORIGIN frame defines the following flags:

   CLEAR (0x1):  Indicates that the Origin Set MUST be reset to an empty
      set before processing the contents of the frame it occurs upon.

   REMOVE (0x2):  Indicates that the origin(s) carried in the payload
      must be removed from the Origin Set, if present; if not present,
      it/they have no effect.

2.1.  The Origin Set

   The set of origins (as per [RFC6454]) that a given connection might
   be used for is known in this specification as the Origin Set.

   When a connection is first established, its Origin Set is defined to
   be the origin composed from: - Scheme: "https" - Host: the value sent
   in Server Name Indication [RFC6066] - Port: the local port of the
   connection on the server

   If SNI is not sent, the Origin Set is empty when the connection is
   established.

   The ORIGIN frame allows the server to modify the Origin Set. In
   particular:

   1.  A server can add to its members by sending an ORIGIN frame
       (without any flags set);

   2.  A server can prune one or more origins from it by sending them in
       an ORIGIN frame with the REMOVE flag set;

   3.  A server can remove all its members and then add zero or more
       members by sending an ORIGIN frame with the CLEAR flag set and a
       payload containing the new origins.

   Adding to the Origin Set (cases 1 and 3 above) does not imply that
   the connection is authoritative for the added origins (in the sense
   of [RFC7540], Section 10.1) on its own; see Section 2.2.

2.2.  Establishing Authority and Coalescing with ORIGIN

   [RFC7540], Section 10.1 uses both DNS and the presented TLS
   certificate to establish the authority of an origin server, just as
   HTTP/1.1 does in [RFC7230].

   Upon receiving an ORIGIN frame on a connection, clients that
   implement this specification are released from the requirement to
   establish authority for a given origin using DNS, for that
   connection.  However, they MUST still establish authority using the
   certificate, as described in [RFC7540] Section 9.1.1.

   Once such a frame is received, an implementing client MUST NOT use
   that connection for a given origin unless it appears in the
   connection's Origin Set. Implementing clients SHOULD use a connection
   for all origins which it is authoritative for, if they are included
   in its Origin Set.

2.3.  Processing ORIGIN Frames

   The ORIGIN frame is a non-critical extension to HTTP/2.  Endpoints
   that do not support this frame can safely ignore it upon receipt.

   When received by an implementing client, it is used to manipulate the
   Origin Set (see Section 2.1).

   The origin frame MUST be sent on stream 0; an ORIGIN frame on any
   other stream is invalid and MUST be ignored.

   The ORIGIN frame is processed hop-by-hop.  An intermediary MUST NOT
   forward ORIGIN frames.  Clients configured to use a proxy MUST ignore
   any ORIGIN frames received from it.

   The following algorithm illustrates how a client can handle received
   ORIGIN frames:

   1.  If the client is configured to use a proxy for the connection,
       ignore the frame and stop processing.

   2.  If the frame occurs upon any stream except stream 0, ignore the
       frame and stop processing.

   3.  If the CLEAR flag is set, remove all members from the Origin Set.

   4.  For each Origin field "origin_raw" in the frame payload:

       1.  Parse "origin_raw" as an ASCII serialization of an origin
           ([RFC6454], Section 6.2) and let the result be
           "parsed_origin".  If parsing fails, skip to the next
           "origin_raw".

       2.  If the REMOVE flag is set, remove any member of the Origin
           Set that is the same as "parsed_origin" (as per [RFC6454],
           Section 5), and continue to the next "parsed_origin".

       3.  Otherwise, add "parsed_origin" to the Origin Set.

3.  Security Considerations

   Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN frame's contents will be
   vulnerable to a large number of attacks.
