# Shepherd Writeup for RFC5987bis

## 1. Summary

Mark Nottingham is the Document Shepherd. The responsible AD is Alexey Melnikov.

By default, header field values in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages cannot easily carry
characters outside the US-ASCII coded character set. RFC 2231 defines an encoding mechanism for use
in parameters inside Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) header field values. This
document specifies an encoding suitable for use in HTTP header fields that is compatible with a
simplified profile of the encoding defined in RFC 2231.

The intended status is Proposed Standard, unchanged from RFC5987. The Working Group felt that
promoting it to full Internet Standard would be inappropriate.
